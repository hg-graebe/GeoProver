GeoProver
=========

The GeoProver is a small package for mechanized (plane) geometry manipulations
with non degeneracy tracing, available for different CAS platforms (Maple,
MuPAD, Maxima, Mathematica, and Reduce).

The latest version 1.3 was finished at Jan 20, 2003 and was since that time
under casual revision.  In particular, in 2017 a version for Maxima was added.

The different packages are build from a common generic source description
(macro definitions) and CAS-specific basic inline code together with help
system and tests.

After a change of the format of the generic source description this build
process has to be fixed.

The precompiled versions for the different target CAS are available in the
`src` directory.  See the README.md in the different directories for more
details.
